  <h1>Mauris Tincidunt</h1>
  <p>A piece of software that I personally use frequently enough to appreciate its efficacy, reliability and ease of use is a 2D image editor called Aseprite. 
    Aseprite is an application that is generally used for artistic purposes, as its built-in tools are designed to create artwork in a very limited canvas size. 
    This artwork as a result typically mimics the retro graphics that were commonplace in video games created in the 1990’s, often being as small as 8 bit or 16 bit. 
    The reason that I believe Aseprite is well designed software is because of how it is laid out. The key concept that the software is based around is simplicity, 
    meaning that there aren’t extensive amounts of tools or settings that a user could be overwhelmed by. 
    This leads to a much more efficient process, and a quicker learning curve, allowing users to master the software in a brief period of time. 
    Another boon of its simplistic nature is that every offered component of the software functions reliably the same, 
    and generates very few problems or inconsistencies for the user. 
    Aseprite succeeds directly from its well designed format, 
    as it is often the most recommended software for users who may be interested in 2D image editing as a hobby or even a profession. 
    This indicates that software being designed well can and will directly lead to an increase in sales, and overall interest in a product that is being marketed. 
    Most customers looking to purchase software that fits their specific needs will consider many factors before purchasing the product, 
    namely the user experience of the software. If software is not designed well, it will not only make it less likely for its users to maintain interest in the product, 
    but it will also dissuade potential buyers from considering purchasing the product in the first place. 
    It is important to ensure that any software that is being designed for a market is designed well, 
    and considers the overall user experience, efficacy, reliability and ease of use of their product before it ever reaches the market.
